#	to start your application on a VIS system.

#	The VIS menuing system is not available without a full VIS license.

#	This section specifies the registration code for your product.
#	Be sure that you use each registration code on a single title.
#	Additional registration codes are available for additional titles.

#	Enter the registration code exactly as it appears on the
#	form you received.  If there are letters in the code, be sure you

#	This next section defines the commands that will be performed by
#	the system when your program is to be run.  Windows applications
#	specify only the name of the directory containing a SYSTEM.INI for
#	that particular program.   The Windows application and its 
#	SYSTEM.INI may be placed in the root directory if you prefer.

#	On the PROGRAM line, you may specify as many DOS commands as are
#	needed to set up the environment, up to 120 characters.  Separate each
#	command line with a '\r'.  When Windows applications are specified,
#	you must use the syntax   minwin A:<directory path> [env1=parms ...]
#	such as		minwin A:\\MYAPP env1=usemouse
#	NOTE:  When a real backslash is needed in a command line, use two
#	backslashes to indicate this.
#	When the last command on the PROGRAM line terminates, the system
#	will restart automatically.

PROGRAM 1	"A:cardtal2.exe                                        "

#	Here are some other examples of possible PROGRAM lines:
#	PROGRAM 2	"A:second.exe /a /b /c:4"
#	PROGRAM 3	"A:mouse.com /x:73 \rminwin A:\\thirddir"
#	PROGRAM 4	"minwin A:\\fourth parm1=myparm"
#	Remember, the double backslash on directory names are required.


#	This optional section allows you to specify one or more buttons
#	on the hand controller that the customer may press to start the 
#	CD-player instead of the application outlined in PROGRAM 1.
#	This should be used ONLY if your disc contains redbook audio
#	tracks (mixed-mode) that are interesting to listen to by themselves.
#	If there are no redbook tracks on your program disc, this parameter
#	is ignored.

BUTTON	3 0 CDPLAYER

#	The above command means that the customer may press the "3" key
#	on the hand controller when the VIS logo appears on the screen
#	and the system will run the built-in CD-PLAYER application
#	instead of the application.
#	More than one key on the controller can be enabled for this task
#	by adding additional BUTTON commands.
#	Valid button codes are:  A B 1 2 3 4 N S E W


#	This section indicates how many audio tracks are present,
#	and what the first track is that contains audio.

#	End of File
