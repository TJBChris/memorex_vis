# GALs

This folder contains dumps of the various GALs found on the Tandy Developer Boards.  Each board gets its own folder; file names within the folder indicate the socket number (e.g. U11) and the type of GAL (e.g. GAL22V10).

## Table of Contents

* **serial_loader** - GALs for the Serial Loader Card (which is installed into the VIS for development/debugging).
