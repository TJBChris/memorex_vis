TUTORIAL.DOC

The tutorial that is located on the disc can be run by inserting the disc
into a VIS system and booting.  Select the "Talking Tutorial" button and the
demo will run.  The demonstration requires that you have the audio connected
and turned up.

The entire demonstration runs in 640x400x256.  

Note that after the discussion of pincushioning, the demonstration ends.
This is normal.

All of the still images from the demonstration may be viewed at your
own pace by selecting the "Tutorial Stills" button at the main menu.
The hand controller may be used to step forward and backwards through
the images.

The audio for the tutorial mentions the Haiku Software Development Kit
and the utility FILTER24.  Microsoft has since changed the name of both
of these items.  The CONVER24 utility may now be found in the Modular
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).
