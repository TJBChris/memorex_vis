SHOWDIB  -  Displays DIB files in 320x200x256 and 640x400x256 video modes

Syntax
	SHOWDIB [-n] [-f file] file1 [file2] ...

SHOWDIB accepts the names of one or more DIB/BMP files and displays them
one at a time.  The program can be used on any PC with VESA BIOS support,
and can also be used on the VIS platform.  

Options

-n	 Do not display the filename on the screen.  By default the
	 name of the file being displayed is shown in the upper left corner.

-f file	 Accepts the name of a file containing a list of one or more files
	 to display.  Files must be organized one per line.
	 Additional files can be specified on the command line as well.

When SHOWDIB is run, it sets the video mode that is correct for the given
file, loads the palette, and then displays the image.  The name of the
file is displayed, and SHOWDIB then waits for a command.  The following
keys are accepted:

Keyboard	VIS Hand	Action
		Controller
[SPACE]		A or S		Display next image
[ENTER]		A or S		Display next image
[DOWNARROW]	A or S		Display next image

[UPARROW]	N or 1		Display previous image

[HOME]		4		Display first image in list

[END]		B or 3		Exit
[BREAK]		B or 3		Exit
[CTRL-C]	B or 3		Exit

On a VIS system, the standard keyboard may also be used.

While the image is being drawn, any of the above keys may be pressed
and the drawing of the current image will be aborted and the specified
operation will occur.
