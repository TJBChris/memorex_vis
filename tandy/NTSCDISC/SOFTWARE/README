
GCD.EXE		Changes the current directory to the one specified.
		For VIS systems, it is the equivalent of the MS-DOS
		CD (change directory) command.

LINEPAIR.EXE	Disables Line Pairing in 200 line video modes and
		causes the VIS system to produce a NTSC-compliant
		signal in those modes.  This utility or equivalent
		code must be used if the output of a VIS is to be
		recorded on videotape.
