
GBIOS release notes 05-07-92

1.0 - Introduction

The Gryphon BIOS will provide a set of services for using some of the
unique devices in the Gryphon system.  GBIOS (GBIOS.COM) is a TSR
program that emulates many of the Gryphon BIOS services.

GBIOS implements the functions documented in section 4 of the Gryphon
BIOS API specification.  This TSR must be executed before using any of
these funcitons.  GBIOS hooks INT 15h to install the Gryphon BIOS
services.  Note that if you have a previous version of GBIOS it may
have been named GBIOS.EXE instead of GBIOS.COM.

GBIOS works with the various development system adapter boards which
emulate some of the subsystems of the Gryphon system.  These include
the memory card adapter board, hand controller adapter board, and audio
adapter board.

GBIOS.COM can accept the following command line parameters.  Command
line parsing is very primitive so be sure to follow these formats
precisely.  All caps, no spaces between slashes and equals.

	/HI=x	where x is the IRQ assigned to the hand controller card

	/WI=x	where x is the IRQ assigned to the wave audio card

	/WD=x	where x indicates which DMA channel the wave audio card
		uses.  x=1 for DMA channel 5, x=2 for DMA channel 6,
		and x=3 for DMA channel 7.  In other words, x+4 is the
		DMA channel you want to use.

These defaults are used if the corresponding command line parameter is
missing.

	hand controller on IRQ 3

	wave audio on IRQ 7 and DMA 7

Problems should be reported through our BBS system.  The BBS number is
(817) 878-xxxx.  If you do not have an account contact Dennis T. at
Tandy at (817) 390-xxxx.  If you have problems accessing the BBS,
contact the sysop Jim Wallace at (817) 390-xxxx.  Of course, if you are
getting this from the BBS, then you already have this information!

The following sections contain notes on the various services provided
by GBIOS.  Refer to the Gryphon BIOS API specification February 27,
1992 for more information.

2.0 - System services (INT15h/AX=7100h)

All the functions are implemented with the following limitations.

Get Equipment List (INT15h/AX=7100h/BH=1) will indicate a keyboard is 
installed only if a 101-key keyboard is installed.  It will indicate a 
mouse is installed only if a mouse driver (MOUSE.COM) is installed.  If 
you loading a mouse driver, MOUSE.COM should be executed before 
GBIOS.COM.

The information returned by Get System Information
(INT15h/AX=7100h/BH=3) may change but the general format of the
information is correct.

3.0 - Hand controller services (INT15h/AX=7101h)

All functions are implemented.

Get Hand Controller Information (INT15h/AX=7101h/BH=0), which can be
used to reset the hand controller system, will NOT clear the callback
address as documented in the 02/27/92 API spec.  This is a spec change.

4.0 - Waveform output services.

All functions are implemented.

5.0 - Waveform input services.

All functions are implemented.

Failures are known to occur when recording.  The frequency of the
failures will vary from system to system.

6.0 - Synthesizer services

None, nothing, zilcho, nill, null, goose egg, no functions are
implemented.  More information and code updates will be provided as it
becomes available.

7.0 - Mixer services

All functions are implemented.

8.0 - THE END
